# Project-4
## **Group Members:**
- Cody Osieczonek
- Tyler White
- Lauren Amoroso


## **Background:**
We are taking data from a bank loan status dataset taken from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zaurbegiev/my-dataset?select=credit_test.csv and using it to predict the probababilty of a loan defaulting using machine learning algorithms.

## **Objectives:**
We will train a model with machine learning using the bank loan status dataset to predict the probababilty of a loan defaulting based on the following data:
- Credit score.
- Annual income.
- Montly debt.
- Debt to income ratio.
- Current loan amount.
- Current credit balance vs Max Open Credit (credit usage ratio)
- Number of past bankrupcies.
- Number of credit problems.
- Number of open accounts.
- Months since last delinquent

- **README.md:** - This readme file.
- **/Resources/credit_data.csv** - The original dataset that is used in our project before any ETL work was performed.


## **Sources:**
- Our dataset located in "/Resources/credit_data.csv" originated from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zaurbegiev/my-dataset?select=credit_test.csv. We renamed it from "credit_test.csv" to "credit_data.csv".
